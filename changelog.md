# Changelog

## Version 1.1 (22 May 2019)

* Added Filesaver.js for larger and more consistent downloading/saving.
* Added themes menu and a range of visual and colourful themes.
* Added examples to the menu of the same name. That helps with layout in smaller windows and makes using examples easier.
* Selecting paths is now easier as you can select any point along it, instead of just the start of the path. That means you can click pretty much anywhere on a curve/arc, or the start/end vertices of straight line segments.
* Various other bug fixes and improvements.
